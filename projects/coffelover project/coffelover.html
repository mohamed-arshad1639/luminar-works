        <div>
            <p class="hist-para"><strong>Coffee</strong> grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to
                the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first
                discovered the potential of these beloved beans.

                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from
                a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.

                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries
                and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
                discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
                spread.

                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring
                these beans across the globe.

                        coffee or an Americano is just hot water which has a shot of espresso.

                        To make an Americano, you must pour the hot water first. Fill two-thirds of a cup with hot water
                        and add one shot of espresso over the hot water.</p>

                    <p><strong>Espresso</strong> is a coffee-making method which has its origins in Italy. To make
                        espresso you need a
                        small amount of nearly boiling water forced under pressure through ground coffee beans. You can
                        get an espresso made with a variety of coffee beans and roasts. What makes an espresso stand out
                        is the fact that it has a thicker consistency and has a foamy cream on top. Because of the
                        pressurised brewing process, espresso is a lot more concentrated.

                        Throughout the years, espresso became the base for all sort of types of coffee like latte,
                        cappuccinos, macchiato, mocha or flat white. The actual caffeine content of any coffee drinks
                        varies based on size, bean origin and roast method. Although espresso has a lot more caffeine
                        per unit volume than most coffee beverages, remember that a small serving of espresso has less
                        caffeine content than a regular cup of coffee.

                        To make espresso you will need an espresso machine. It is believed that Angelo Moriondo, from
                        Turin, created the first espresso machine in 1884. Nowadays, you can get an espresso pretty much
                        anywhere. You can even get affordable espresso machines in your own home.

                        To make espresso you just need one single shot of espresso in a cup. That's all, nothing else
                        added.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cappuccino</strong> Oh sweet cappuccinos, how I love you. Nowadays, I always buy a
                        cappuccino. A cappuccino is made by pouring an espresso shot into a cup, then top it with
                        steamed milk and foam in an equal ration. You should sprinkle ground chocolate on top of the
                        foam, although I specifically ask all barista to omit this step for me.

                        The reason why I love cappuccinos is because of their delicious, creamier taste. I adore milk
                        foam too, as it creates a softer flavour when the espresso passes through it.

                        During the winter months, you will find cappuccinos topped with cinnamon powder or nutmeg on the
                        top for a most festive taste.

                        Tip: in Italy, a cappuccino is a breakfast drink which shouldn't be ordered after 12 pm.
                        Although don't worry, you will still get your brew if you order it at any time of the day.

                        To make cappuccino, extract one shot of espresso in a cup. Add steamed milk and 3 cm of foamed
                        milk. Sprinkle chocolate or cinnamon on top.

                        To make vegan cappuccino, simply replace the milk with a plant-based alternative. We recommend
                        oat milk as it yields the creamiest result in our experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mocha</strong> A mocha is a cross between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. If you have
                        a sweet tooth, then this is probably your best bet. You can find a mocha in a super simple form
                        which is a shot of espresso topped with hot chocolate. But the more sophisticated mocha has a
                        shot of espresso, a small part of hot chocolate (or hot chocolate syrup), topped with steamed
                        milk and milk foam.

                        The idea behind a mocha is to have an extraordinarily extravagant drink. Hot chocolate should be
                        silky and smooth and combined with the sweetness of the milk and the bitterness of the espresso,
                        you have the perfect, most indulgent beverage.

                        But mocha as a name can be a little confusing. Mocha coffee is not the same as mocha coffee
                        beans. Mocha beans come from a place called Mocha in Yemen. The funny thing is that Mocha beans
                        are known to have a hint of chocolate.

                        Either way, a mocha can be done with delicious chocolate powder or syrup or can become a
                        gorgeous white mocha, made with white chocolate instead.

                        To make the perfect mocha, extract one shot of espresso into a cup. Add one spoon of chocolate
                        powder into the espresso and mix. Top it up with steamed milk and around 3 cm of milk foam. If
                        you like, you can sprinkle chocolate powder on top. Yum!

                    <p><strong>Latte</strong> A is relatively similar to a cappuccino, although the ratio of espresso,
                        steamed milk and milk foam is different. A latte should be served in a tumbler glass, although
                        it is now more common to see it a regular coffee mug.

                        To create the perfect latte extract one shot of espresso, then pour steamed milk over. The latte
                        should have a minimal amount of milk foam on top, used to create "latte art".

                        Latte is the Italian word for milk and in Italy, this beverage means milk coffee. However, a
                        latte is a lot more than just coffee with milk on top. The steamed milk is the star attraction
                        in a latte with just a tad bit of foam on the top. Many coffee shops in the world train their
                        baristas to create some of the most incredible latte art you can imagine. There are restaurants
                        in Tokyo which specialise in designing beautiful coffee.

                    <p><strong>cortado, </strong>The first time I encountered "cortado" on a coffee shop menu I was
                        super
                        confused. I was well versed in differences between latte and cappuccino, but a cortado? What
                        that might be?

                        The reason why I was confused? Well, Cortado is not an Italian word, but Spanish! A cortado is a
                        beverage made with one shot of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of steamed milk.

                        The important part to remember is that a cortado has steamed milk and not frothy or texturised
                        in any way like in many Italian coffees.

                        You will find a cortado in many places in Spain, Portugal and Cuba. And if anyone asks, a
                        cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb "cortar" which means to cut. In this context,
                        a cortado is used in the sense of diluting (cutting the drink with something). This is because
                        the milk reduces the acidity of the coffee.

                        steamed milk over it. No milk foam, no toppings. Flat whites are popular in Australia and New
                        Zealand so expect to see them on the menu during your trip abroad.

                    <p><strong>Macchiato</strong> One of my favourite lunch drinks, the delicious macchiato. A macchiato
                        is essentially an espresso with the tiniest dollop of milk foam over it. In Italian, macchiato
                        means stained or spotted, and this is exactly what we are doing to the espresso here: we are
                        staining it with a little milk foam.

                        The origin of the name is really quite interesting. It comes from baristas needing to show the
                        waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a little milk in it. So the
                        latter was especially marked which became the macchiato.

                        This idea can also be seen in places in Portugal where the name for the drink café pintado means
                        coffee with a drop. It's the same as a macchiato.

                        You can ask for a macchiato which is a single espresso with a dollop of milk foam or a double
                        macchiato which is a doppio (double espresso) with a dollop of milk foam. Just note that
                        different baristas will have their own way of doing the macchiato. You will find some who add a
                        dollop of steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam. It's all down to the training and individual
                        preference.

                <p><strong>Con Panna</strong> Now, this is my personal indulgent drink. And you know what is great about
                    this
                    drink? You can make it, fully vegan, at home. So what is Con Panna? Panna means cream in Italian so
                    espresso con panna means espresso with cream.

                    If you read this from the USA, you might know it as café Vienne. In France and in the United Kingdom
                    it's called café Viennois. In Northern Europe, however, Wiener Melange is about a completely
                    different drink which is made with espresso, topped with foamed milk and whipped cream on top.

                    In Vienna, a Con Panna is called Franziskaner, although, during our trip to Vienna, we found that
                    ordering a Wiener Melange sometimes meant just espresso with whipped cream.

                    A Con Panna is a more old fashioned way of having coffee than a latte or a cappuccino. This drink is
                    still very popular and whether you name it "Con Panna" or café Viennois you will most certainly
                    enjoy it.

                    To recreate your favourite Con Panna, extract a shot of espresso into a cup, then add whipped cream
                    on top.
